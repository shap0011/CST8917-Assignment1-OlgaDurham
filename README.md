## Part 1: Paper Summary (400-600 words)

### 1.1 Main Argument (central thesis)

Hellerstein et al. argue that today’s “serverless” offerings, especially Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) like AWS Lambda, deliver a real breakthrough in operational simplicity and autoscaling: developers can upload code, trigger it by events, and pay only for execution without managing servers. That’s the “one step forward.”

But they claim serverless also takes “two steps back” because the current model is built around short-lived, isolated, non-addressable functions that are separated from data and from each other. This design makes many modern workloads, especially data-intensive and distributed/stateful systems, inefficient or impractical, and it nudges developers toward proprietary managed services instead of enabling broad innovation on the cloud platform. (Hellerstein et al., 2019)
